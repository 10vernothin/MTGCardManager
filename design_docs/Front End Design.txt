This is the current front-end design that is being worked on.

page Home {
	-Welcomes the user
	-will have button to login page or collections page depending on whether the user is logged in
	-will have a button to show all registered users
}

page Login {
	-The user will login through this page
	-Will have a signup, signin and a home button
	-Will implement login through RESTful API with the Express backend
	-Any unauthorized intrusion to authorized pages will redirect to this page
}

page Sign-up {
	-Lets user sign up.
	-Implements signup through the backend.
}

page Collection {
	-An interface to let the user create, select or delete collections.
	-Will have a table of collection names, and buttons that will let the user access the collection 
	-All creation, selection and/or deletion of a collection will be done through the backend.
	}
	
page Collection/?create-new-collection {
	-An interface that allows the user to create a new collection.
	-Will implement collection creation through backend.
}

...

Other planned functionality in the future:
- page that consist of a list of cards within a collection
- page/popup for adding new cards, deleting cards from collection
- updating the card info through Scryfall API using an update button
- creating a "real" cache.
- cleaning up routing to fit more with RESTful-like API
