Buehler's Draw, Go deck is built for pure control with over twenty counters. He uses eight card-drawing spells to get to his counters more quickly and only four Stalking Stones and one Rainbow Efreet for offensive power. Buehler said he won some games without ever having to tap a land for mana on his own turn.","colors":[],"color_identity":[],"legalities":{"standard":"not_legal","future":"not_legal","historic":"not_legal","pioneer":"not_legal","modern":"not_legal","legacy":"not_legal","pauper":"not_legal","vintage":"not_legal","penny":"not_legal","commander":"not_legal","brawl":"not_legal","duel":"not_legal","oldschool":"not_legal"},"games":[],"reserved":false,"foil":false,"nonfoil":true,"oversized":false,"promo":false,"reprint":false,"variation":false,"set":"wc98","set_name":"World Championship Decks 1998","set_type":"memorabilia","set_uri":"https://api.scryfall.com/sets/e8732c3a-160c-41da-bc79-5da86431b17d","set_search_uri":"https://api.scryfall.com/cards/search?order=set&q=e%3Awc98&unique=prints","scryfall_set_uri":"https://scryfall.com/sets/wc98?utm_source=api","rulings_uri":"https://api.scryfall.com/cards/23239786-8ac6-460c-9c19-c439b8fa9734/rulings","prints_search_uri":"https://api.scryfall.com/cards/search?order=released&q=oracleid%3A5e1632d7-7e68-4589-8655-bd1d19497903&unique=prints","collector_number":"rb0a","digital":false,"rarity":"common","card_back_id":"df9a3149-dae5-4319-85bb-00d37c023360","artist":"","border_color":"gold","frame":"1997","full_art":false,"textless":false,"booster":false,"story_spotlight":false,"prices":{"usd":null,"usd_foil":null,"eur":null,"tix":null},"related_uris":{"tcgplayer_decks":"https://decks.tcgplayer.com/magic/deck/search?contains=Randy+Buehler+Bio&page=1&partner=Scryfall&utm_campaign=affiliate&utm_medium=api&utm_source=scryfall","edhrec":"https://edhrec.com/route/?cc=Randy+Buehler+Bio","mtgtop8":"https://mtgtop8.com/search?MD_check=1&SB_check=1&cards=Randy+Buehler+Bio"},"purchase_uris":{"tcgplayer":"https://shop.tcgplayer.com/productcatalog/product/show?ProductName=Randy+Buehler+Bio&partner=Scryfall&utm_campaign=affiliate&utm_medium=api&utm_source=scryfall","cardmarket":"https://www.cardmarket.com/en/Magic/Products/Search?referrer=scryfall&searchString=Randy+Buehler+Bio&utm_campaign=card_prices&utm_medium=text&utm_source=scryfall","cardhoarder":"https://www.cardhoarder.com/cards?affiliate_id=scryfall&data%5Bsearch%5D=Randy+Buehler+Bio&ref=card-profile&utm_campaign=affiliate&utm_medium=card&utm_source=scryfall"}}
