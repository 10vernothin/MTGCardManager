Though he went only 4—2 during the Swiss portion of the World Championships, he cruised through the Final 8 to become the 1999 World Champion. The 19-year-old Köln, Germany native played a red-artifact deck that contained more than 30 artifacts. He used those artifacts to quickly generate huge amounts of mana, with which he could play a big creature like Masticore or Covetous Dragon. He would then finish off his opponent with a well-timed Wildfire.","colors":[],"color_identity":[],"legalities":{"standard":"not_legal","future":"not_legal","historic":"not_legal","pioneer":"not_legal","modern":"not_legal","legacy":"not_legal","pauper":"not_legal","vintage":"not_legal","penny":"not_legal","commander":"not_legal","brawl":"not_legal","duel":"not_legal","oldschool":"not_legal"},"games":[],"reserved":false,"foil":false,"nonfoil":true,"oversized":false,"promo":false,"reprint":false,"variation":false,"set":"wc99","set_name":"World Championship Decks 1999","set_type":"memorabilia","set_uri":"https://api.scryfall.com/sets/8bc653e3-56ce-4cd1-9590-a6134ec28b3a","set_search_uri":"https://api.scryfall.com/cards/search?order=set&q=e%3Awc99&unique=prints","scryfall_set_uri":"https://scryfall.com/sets/wc99?utm_source=api","rulings_uri":"https://api.scryfall.com/cards/9ed2329f-d055-4a60-955b-384722504278/rulings","prints_search_uri":"https://api.scryfall.com/cards/search?order=released&q=oracleid%3A8c893453-cba9-4191-814d-3bf5e45fb93b&unique=prints","collector_number":"kb0a","digital":false,"rarity":"common","card_back_id":"407ed11d-7b6f-4e1c-ab00-f49c25f170e3","artist":"","border_color":"gold","frame":"1997","full_art":false,"textless":false,"booster":false,"story_spotlight":false,"prices":{"usd":null,"usd_foil":null,"eur":null,"tix":null},"related_uris":{"tcgplayer_decks":"https://decks.tcgplayer.com/magic/deck/search?contains=Kai+Budde+Bio&page=1&partner=Scryfall&utm_campaign=affiliate&utm_medium=api&utm_source=scryfall","edhrec":"https://edhrec.com/route/?cc=Kai+Budde+Bio","mtgtop8":"https://mtgtop8.com/search?MD_check=1&SB_check=1&cards=Kai+Budde+Bio"},"purchase_uris":{"tcgplayer":"https://shop.tcgplayer.com/productcatalog/product/show?ProductName=Kai+Budde+Bio&partner=Scryfall&utm_campaign=affiliate&utm_medium=api&utm_source=scryfall","cardmarket":"https://www.cardmarket.com/en/Magic/Products/Search?referrer=scryfall&searchString=Kai+Budde+Bio&utm_campaign=card_prices&utm_medium=text&utm_source=scryfall","cardhoarder":"https://www.cardhoarder.com/cards?affiliate_id=scryfall&data%5Bsearch%5D=Kai+Budde+Bio&ref=card-profile&utm_campaign=affiliate&utm_medium=card&utm_source=scryfall"}}
