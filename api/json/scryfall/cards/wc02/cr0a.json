He simply played his version better than everyone else playing theirs. Rom達o, known as \"Jaba\" to his friends, was a perfect 6-0 during the Swiss portion of the tournament, posting a stunning 12-0 game record. This twenty-year-old native of S達o Paulo, Brazil, has been widely regarded as one of the best players in South America. His deck tried to stay alive long enough to play Upheaval, while floating mana to replay Psychatog on the same turn.","colors":[],"color_identity":[],"legalities":{"standard":"not_legal","future":"not_legal","historic":"not_legal","pioneer":"not_legal","modern":"not_legal","legacy":"not_legal","pauper":"not_legal","vintage":"not_legal","penny":"not_legal","commander":"not_legal","brawl":"not_legal","duel":"not_legal","oldschool":"not_legal"},"games":[],"reserved":false,"foil":false,"nonfoil":true,"oversized":false,"promo":false,"reprint":false,"variation":false,"set":"wc02","set_name":"World Championship Decks 2002","set_type":"memorabilia","set_uri":"https://api.scryfall.com/sets/04dfc9bb-ccaa-436c-b79a-925b2ad9bdbe","set_search_uri":"https://api.scryfall.com/cards/search?order=set&q=e%3Awc02&unique=prints","scryfall_set_uri":"https://scryfall.com/sets/wc02?utm_source=api","rulings_uri":"https://api.scryfall.com/cards/baf955be-0742-483d-a7df-e58792f31817/rulings","prints_search_uri":"https://api.scryfall.com/cards/search?order=released&q=oracleid%3A6d2632ab-69b3-4d6b-895f-e34984008eab&unique=prints","collector_number":"cr0a","digital":false,"rarity":"common","card_back_id":"6bcbb89c-0af2-4510-8484-e59cc0042b09","artist":"","border_color":"gold","frame":"1997","full_art":false,"textless":false,"booster":false,"story_spotlight":false,"prices":{"usd":null,"usd_foil":null,"eur":null,"tix":null},"related_uris":{"tcgplayer_decks":"https://decks.tcgplayer.com/magic/deck/search?contains=Carlos+Rom%C3%A3o+Bio&page=1&partner=Scryfall&utm_campaign=affiliate&utm_medium=api&utm_source=scryfall","edhrec":"https://edhrec.com/route/?cc=Carlos+Rom%C3%A3o+Bio","mtgtop8":"https://mtgtop8.com/search?MD_check=1&SB_check=1&cards=Carlos+Rom%C3%A3o+Bio"},"purchase_uris":{"tcgplayer":"https://shop.tcgplayer.com/productcatalog/product/show?ProductName=Carlos+Rom%C3%A3o+Bio&partner=Scryfall&utm_campaign=affiliate&utm_medium=api&utm_source=scryfall","cardmarket":"https://www.cardmarket.com/en/Magic/Products/Search?referrer=scryfall&searchString=Carlos+Rom%C3%A3o+Bio&utm_campaign=card_prices&utm_medium=text&utm_source=scryfall","cardhoarder":"https://www.cardhoarder.com/cards?affiliate_id=scryfall&data%5Bsearch%5D=Carlos+Rom%C3%A3o+Bio&ref=card-profile&utm_campaign=affiliate&utm_medium=card&utm_source=scryfall"}}
