The white-blue-green \"Wake\" deck is named after the powerful enchantment that's the heart of the deck. Once Mirari's Wake is in play, the deck produces more mana, draws more cards, counters more spells, and makes more Soldiers than opponents can possibly handle. Zink had help from fellow German and 2002-2003 Player of the Year Kai Budde in adapting the \"Wake\" deck to the postâ€”Eigth Edition environment.","colors":[],"color_identity":[],"legalities":{"standard":"not_legal","future":"not_legal","historic":"not_legal","pioneer":"not_legal","modern":"not_legal","legacy":"not_legal","pauper":"not_legal","vintage":"not_legal","penny":"not_legal","commander":"not_legal","brawl":"not_legal","duel":"not_legal","oldschool":"not_legal"},"games":[],"reserved":false,"foil":false,"nonfoil":true,"oversized":false,"promo":false,"reprint":false,"variation":false,"set":"wc03","set_name":"World Championship Decks 2003","set_type":"memorabilia","set_uri":"https://api.scryfall.com/sets/56f42feb-07f4-4fd6-a88b-33209de7de08","set_search_uri":"https://api.scryfall.com/cards/search?order=set&q=e%3Awc03&unique=prints","scryfall_set_uri":"https://scryfall.com/sets/wc03?utm_source=api","rulings_uri":"https://api.scryfall.com/cards/a1352676-9a0e-44bc-972a-b2c26b99e529/rulings","prints_search_uri":"https://api.scryfall.com/cards/search?order=released&q=oracleid%3Ae5fe22bf-28bf-43f6-9eca-badd0a7ba129&unique=prints","collector_number":"dz0a","digital":false,"rarity":"common","card_back_id":"0645a083-9e19-43db-9e76-4a424d53895d","artist":"","border_color":"gold","frame":"2003","full_art":false,"textless":false,"booster":false,"story_spotlight":false,"prices":{"usd":null,"usd_foil":null,"eur":null,"tix":null},"related_uris":{"tcgplayer_decks":"https://decks.tcgplayer.com/magic/deck/search?contains=Daniel+Zink+Bio&page=1&partner=Scryfall&utm_campaign=affiliate&utm_medium=api&utm_source=scryfall","edhrec":"https://edhrec.com/route/?cc=Daniel+Zink+Bio","mtgtop8":"https://mtgtop8.com/search?MD_check=1&SB_check=1&cards=Daniel+Zink+Bio"},"purchase_uris":{"tcgplayer":"https://shop.tcgplayer.com/productcatalog/product/show?ProductName=Daniel+Zink+Bio&partner=Scryfall&utm_campaign=affiliate&utm_medium=api&utm_source=scryfall","cardmarket":"https://www.cardmarket.com/en/Magic/Products/Search?referrer=scryfall&searchString=Daniel+Zink+Bio&utm_campaign=card_prices&utm_medium=text&utm_source=scryfall","cardhoarder":"https://www.cardhoarder.com/cards?affiliate_id=scryfall&data%5Bsearch%5D=Daniel+Zink+Bio&ref=card-profile&utm_campaign=affiliate&utm_medium=card&utm_source=scryfall"}}
