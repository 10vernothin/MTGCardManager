If the exiled card doesn't have suspend, it gains suspend. (At the beginning of its owner's upkeep, they remove a time counter. When the last is removed, the player casts it without paying its mana cost. If it's a creature, it has haste.)\nWhenever you roll {CHAOS}, remove two time counters from each suspended card you own.","colors":[],"color_identity":[],"legalities":{"standard":"not_legal","future":"not_legal","historic":"not_legal","pioneer":"not_legal","modern":"not_legal","legacy":"not_legal","pauper":"not_legal","vintage":"not_legal","penny":"not_legal","commander":"not_legal","brawl":"not_legal","duel":"not_legal","oldschool":"not_legal"},"games":["paper"],"reserved":false,"foil":false,"nonfoil":true,"oversized":true,"promo":false,"reprint":true,"variation":false,"set":"opca","set_name":"Planechase Anthology Planes","set_type":"planechase","set_uri":"https://api.scryfall.com/sets/ada3345c-d416-49bc-92e0-73363ddee5c8","set_search_uri":"https://api.scryfall.com/cards/search?order=set&q=e%3Aopca&unique=prints","scryfall_set_uri":"https://scryfall.com/sets/opca?utm_source=api","rulings_uri":"https://api.scryfall.com/cards/09feed09-96de-4208-b6b9-cac0ec150e70/rulings","prints_search_uri":"https://api.scryfall.com/cards/search?order=released&q=oracleid%3Ac85d3740-8c8d-4fef-ad33-a6f446b883ac&unique=prints","collector_number":"77","digital":false,"rarity":"common","card_back_id":"7840c131-f96b-4700-9347-2215c43156e6","artist":"Chippy","artist_ids":["a36f01a0-e51a-48b2-a556-b9b3bc73f969"],"illustration_id":"ce681b54-936a-4417-b021-564b6173a184","border_color":"black","frame":"2015","full_art":false,"textless":false,"booster":false,"story_spotlight":false,"prices":{"usd":"0.42","usd_foil":null,"eur":null,"tix":null},"related_uris":{"gatherer":"https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=423658","tcgplayer_decks":"https://decks.tcgplayer.com/magic/deck/search?contains=Talon+Gates&page=1&partner=Scryfall&utm_campaign=affiliate&utm_medium=api&utm_source=scryfall","edhrec":"https://edhrec.com/route/?cc=Talon+Gates","mtgtop8":"https://mtgtop8.com/search?MD_check=1&SB_check=1&cards=Talon+Gates"},"purchase_uris":{"tcgplayer":"https://shop.tcgplayer.com/product/productsearch?id=125634&partner=Scryfall&utm_campaign=affiliate&utm_medium=api&utm_source=scryfall","cardmarket":"https://www.cardmarket.com/en/Magic/Products/Search?referrer=scryfall&searchString=Talon+Gates&utm_campaign=card_prices&utm_medium=text&utm_source=scryfall","cardhoarder":"https://www.cardhoarder.com/cards?affiliate_id=scryfall&data%5Bsearch%5D=Talon+Gates&ref=card-profile&utm_campaign=affiliate&utm_medium=card&utm_source=scryfall"}}
