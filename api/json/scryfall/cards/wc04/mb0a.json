His deck uses Krark-Clan Ironworks to quickly get a Myr Incubator into play, which then creates thirty or more 1/1 Myr creatures—sometimes as early as the third turn! A twenty-seven-year-old freelance game designer from Paris, France, Bevand has been a Magic® regular since 1994, playing in over a dozen Pro Tour events. He credits Magic Online for getting him back into championship form.","colors":[],"color_identity":[],"legalities":{"standard":"not_legal","future":"not_legal","historic":"not_legal","pioneer":"not_legal","modern":"not_legal","legacy":"not_legal","pauper":"not_legal","vintage":"not_legal","penny":"not_legal","commander":"not_legal","brawl":"not_legal","duel":"not_legal","oldschool":"not_legal"},"games":[],"reserved":false,"foil":false,"nonfoil":true,"oversized":false,"promo":false,"reprint":false,"variation":false,"set":"wc04","set_name":"World Championship Decks 2004","set_type":"memorabilia","set_uri":"https://api.scryfall.com/sets/d3ff356b-bb3d-4405-a452-34c5cef27329","set_search_uri":"https://api.scryfall.com/cards/search?order=set&q=e%3Awc04&unique=prints","scryfall_set_uri":"https://scryfall.com/sets/wc04?utm_source=api","rulings_uri":"https://api.scryfall.com/cards/f127bd8b-64fd-4fde-b520-345ed27a8585/rulings","prints_search_uri":"https://api.scryfall.com/cards/search?order=released&q=oracleid%3A48e018c8-51c6-4ccd-bdd4-4fef97e985cd&unique=prints","collector_number":"mb0a","digital":false,"rarity":"common","card_back_id":"896307e5-1c5d-49c0-8fb5-8d1059bc1115","artist":"","border_color":"gold","frame":"2003","full_art":false,"textless":false,"booster":false,"story_spotlight":false,"prices":{"usd":null,"usd_foil":null,"eur":null,"tix":null},"related_uris":{"tcgplayer_decks":"https://decks.tcgplayer.com/magic/deck/search?contains=Manuel+Bevand+Bio&page=1&partner=Scryfall&utm_campaign=affiliate&utm_medium=api&utm_source=scryfall","edhrec":"https://edhrec.com/route/?cc=Manuel+Bevand+Bio","mtgtop8":"https://mtgtop8.com/search?MD_check=1&SB_check=1&cards=Manuel+Bevand+Bio"},"purchase_uris":{"tcgplayer":"https://shop.tcgplayer.com/productcatalog/product/show?ProductName=Manuel+Bevand+Bio&partner=Scryfall&utm_campaign=affiliate&utm_medium=api&utm_source=scryfall","cardmarket":"https://www.cardmarket.com/en/Magic/Products/Search?referrer=scryfall&searchString=Manuel+Bevand+Bio&utm_campaign=card_prices&utm_medium=text&utm_source=scryfall","cardhoarder":"https://www.cardhoarder.com/cards?affiliate_id=scryfall&data%5Bsearch%5D=Manuel+Bevand+Bio&ref=card-profile&utm_campaign=affiliate&utm_medium=card&utm_source=scryfall"}}
