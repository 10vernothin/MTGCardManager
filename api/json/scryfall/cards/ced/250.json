If you do, you may cast that card face down as a 2/2 creature spell without paying its mana cost. If the creature that spell becomes as it resolves has not been turned face up and would assign or deal damage, be dealt damage, or become tapped, instead it's turned face up and assigns or deals damage, is dealt damage, or becomes tapped. Activate this ability only any time you could cast a sorcery.","colors":[],"color_identity":[],"legalities":{"standard":"not_legal","future":"not_legal","historic":"not_legal","pioneer":"not_legal","modern":"not_legal","legacy":"legal","pauper":"not_legal","vintage":"legal","penny":"not_legal","commander":"legal","brawl":"not_legal","duel":"legal","oldschool":"legal"},"games":[],"reserved":true,"foil":false,"nonfoil":true,"oversized":false,"promo":false,"reprint":true,"variation":false,"set":"ced","set_name":"Collectorsâ€™ Edition","set_type":"memorabilia","set_uri":"https://api.scryfall.com/sets/fdde66b9-027a-43e8-9aa4-5d338f379ade","set_search_uri":"https://api.scryfall.com/cards/search?order=set&q=e%3Aced&unique=prints","scryfall_set_uri":"https://scryfall.com/sets/ced?utm_source=api","rulings_uri":"https://api.scryfall.com/cards/89dadd54-1a79-4cf9-b715-efcf10aa120d/rulings","prints_search_uri":"https://api.scryfall.com/cards/search?order=released&q=oracleid%3A05ac866d-0405-4d25-986a-c10fcfc097e6&unique=prints","collector_number":"250","digital":false,"rarity":"rare","card_back_id":"98784b63-d263-4abc-aabb-a092e6ecc788","artist":"Amy Weber","artist_ids":["c1160787-e72e-4f89-b361-c6864f7a4e3a"],"illustration_id":"3a98e8c0-60a2-488e-9acf-7429af62e40e","border_color":"black","frame":"1993","full_art":false,"textless":false,"booster":false,"story_spotlight":false,"edhrec_rank":16121,"prices":{"usd":"24.50","usd_foil":null,"eur":"25.08","tix":null},"related_uris":{"tcgplayer_decks":"https://decks.tcgplayer.com/magic/deck/search?contains=Illusionary+Mask&page=1&partner=Scryfall&utm_campaign=affiliate&utm_medium=api&utm_source=scryfall","edhrec":"https://edhrec.com/route/?cc=Illusionary+Mask","mtgtop8":"https://mtgtop8.com/search?MD_check=1&SB_check=1&cards=Illusionary+Mask"},"purchase_uris":{"tcgplayer":"https://shop.tcgplayer.com/product/productsearch?id=97515&partner=Scryfall&utm_campaign=affiliate&utm_medium=api&utm_source=scryfall","cardmarket":"https://www.cardmarket.com/en/Magic/Products/Singles/Collectors-Edition/Illusionary-Mask?referrer=scryfall&utm_campaign=card_prices&utm_medium=text&utm_source=scryfall","cardhoarder":"https://www.cardhoarder.com/cards?affiliate_id=scryfall&data%5Bsearch%5D=Illusionary+Mask&ref=card-profile&utm_campaign=affiliate&utm_medium=card&utm_source=scryfall"}}
